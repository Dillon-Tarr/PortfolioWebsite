          <p>I am a child of God, the King and Creator of all things. Though I once chose death, my life has been saved by the blood of Jesus the Messiah.</p>
          <p>I recently completed devCodeCamp's Web Development course and am looking for employment in a field that allows me to do good work with my brain.
            I had played with HTML, CSS, and Python prior to that. I am proficient in MERN stack development.</p>
          <p>I want to earn more money than I am now so I can better provide for my wife, church, and community now and in the future.</p>
          <p>With my feet sufficiently wet, I am ready to dive in alongside other developers who create things to make the world a better place and add value to a business, project, or community.</p>
          <p>Some things I like or like to do include, in no particular order:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Music</li>
            <li>Finding out about something new and spending longer than I initially anticipated learning more about it</li>
            <li>Seeing the beauty in creation and praising the Lord for it</li>
            <li>Spending time with my friends and family</li>
            <li>Video games</li>
            <li>Discussing things that matter, and laughing about things that don't</li>
            <li>Having fun</li>
            <li>Questioning why things are the way they are</li>
            <li>Disarming problems</li>
            <li>Testing things</li>
            <li>Tracing logical arguments to their conclusions, which for some reason I didn't appreciate as much when I took high school geometry</li>
            <li>Having my assumptions and ideas shattered in such a way as to impress something educational or helpful into my memory</li>
            <li>Noticing that I'm overthinking or overanalyzing something, then just making a decision</li>
            <li>Being thankful</li>
            <li>Stopping, pausing, waiting, trusting, hoping</li>
            <li>Starting something new</li>
            <li>Imagining the future, taking steps toward it, and finding out it wasn't what I had imagined</li>
          </ul>
